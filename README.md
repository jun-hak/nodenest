## The Problem

We've all been there: You ask ChatGPT to explain a complex topic, and it gives you a perfect 500-word essay. You read it, nod, and feel smart.

**Two days later? You remember nothing.**

Why? Because **reading isn't learning**. True understanding happens when you connect concepts, see relationships, and build a mental model. Linear chat windows destroy that. They turn knowledge into an infinite, scrolling receipt.

## The Solution

I built **NodeNest** to fix how we learn from AI.

It forces the conversation out of the timeline and onto a canvas. When you learn something new, it doesn't just scroll away—it becomes a permanent node in your map. 

- **It's Socratic:** The AI is prompted to guide you, not lecture you.
- **It's Visual:** Your knowledge grows like a tree. You can literally *see* what you know.
- **It's Semantic:** Concepts are linked by logic, not just time.

## NodeNest vs Standard Chat

| | **NodeNest** | Standard Chatbots |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| 🧠 Mental Model | **Visual Knowledge Graph** | Infinite Wall of Text |
| 🎓 Teaching Style | **Socratic (Asks questions)** | Lecture Mode |
| 🌳 Structure | **Breadth-First Tree** | Linear Rabbit Hole |
| 🖼️ Visuals | **Context-Aware Diagrams** | Generic Stock Images |
| 🕵️ Tracking | **None** | Yes |

## Quick setup (2 minutes)

1.  **Clone it:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akshayaggarwal99/nodenest.git
    cd nodenest
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Get a Gemini Key (Free):**
    - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
    - Get an API key (it's free for 1M tokens/day)
    - Create `.env.local`:
      ```env
      GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_key_here
      ```

4.  **Run it:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

That's it. Open `http://localhost:3000` and start mapping.

## Under the Hood

Built with the absolute bleeding edge stack because it's fun:

- **Next.js 16 (Turbopack)** - Fast as lightning.
- **Google Gemini 3 Flash Preview** - The smartest, fastest model I could find.
- **React Flow + Dagre** - Auto-layout magic that just works.
- **Zustand** - State management.
- **Tailwind v4** - Styling for the future.

## Deploy your own (Free)

The easiest way to deploy this is with **Vercel** (creators of Next.js).

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fakshayaggarwal99%2Fnodenest&env=GEMINI_API_KEY)

1. Click the button above.
2. Link your GitHub account.
3. Paste your Gemini API Key when asked.
4. **Done.** You have a live URL to share.

*Note: Since this uses server-side API routes for AI, it cannot be hosted on GitHub Pages.*

Or just use it to master a hard topic. That's enough for me.
